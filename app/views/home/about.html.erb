            <p class="text-justify">The company Dronnie was established in 2015 by a passionate drone flyer. A simple present gift, soon became my new way of life. 2 years later I have designed my first model, called XYZ 13, that became one of the most popular drones flown in Europe. I am happy to share that passion with you. It doesn't matter if you are 8 or 80. As long as you like drones, this page is for you!</li></p>
