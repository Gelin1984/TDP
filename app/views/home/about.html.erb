<h3><i>because plain CV is not enough ...</i></h1><br></h3>
<h3>TDP is a company established in 2017 in Beijing, China.<br>
 It was created by the passionate language teacher, Greg Dopart.<br> Having tried to connect his passion for coding and education,<br> he came up with the idea of helping international school teachers with creating <br>their digital portfolios. Adding a filmography, including short interviews<br> with students, staff members and parents was a bull's eye!
